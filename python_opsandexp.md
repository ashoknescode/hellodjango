## What you will learn in this section
Youâ€™ll learn about expressions, operators, sequences, and more.

### Introduction
Most statements (logical lines) that you write in any programming language contain expressions. A simple example of an expression is 2 + 3. An expression can be broken down into operators and operands.

**Operators and operands:** Operators are functionality that do something and can be represented by symbols such as + or by special keywords. Operators require some data to operate on and such data is called operands. In this case, 2 and 3 are the operands. Some of the well known operators are:

SL NO | OPERATORS | DESCRIPTIONS | EXAMPLE
--------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------
1 | + (plus) | Add two number | 3 + 5 gives 8. 'a' + 'b' gives 'ab'
2 | - (minus) | Gives the subtraction of one number from the other | 50 - 24 gives 26
3 | * (multiply) | Gives the multiplication of the two numbers or returns the string repeated that many times. | 2 * 3 gives 6. 'la' * 3 gives 'lalala'
4 | ** (power) | Returns x to the power of y | 3 ** 4 gives 81
5 | / (divide) | Divide x by y | 13 / 3 gives 4.333333333333333
