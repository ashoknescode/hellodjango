## What you will learn in this section
Youâ€™ll learn about expressions, operators, sequences, and more.

### Introduction
Most statements (logical lines) that you write in any programming language contain expressions. A simple example of an expression is 2 + 3. An expression can be broken down into operators and operands.

**Operators and operands:** Operators are functionality that do something and can be represented by symbols such as + or by special keywords. Operators require some data to operate on and such data is called operands. In this case, 2 and 3 are the operands. Some of the well known operators with descriptions and examples are:

SL | OPERATORS | DESCRIPTIONS | EXAMPLE
--------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------
1 | + (plus) | Add two number | 3 + 5 gives 8. 'a' + 'b' gives 'ab'
2 | - (minus) | Gives the subtraction of one number from the other | 50 - 24 gives 26
3 | * (multiply) | Gives the multiplication of the two numbers or returns the string repeated that many times. | 2 * 3 gives 6. 'la' * 3 gives 'lalala'
4 | ** (power) | Returns x to the power of y | 3 ** 4 gives 81
5 | / (divide) | Divide x by y | 13 / 3 gives 4.333333333333333
6 | // (divide and floor) | Divide x by y and round the answer down to the nearest whole number | 13 // 3 gives 4
7 | % (modulo) | Returns the remainder of the division | 13 % 3 gives 1
8 | << (left shift) | Shifts the bits of the number to the left by the number of bits specified. | 2 << 2 gives 8
9 | >> (right shift) | Shifts the bits of the number to the right by the number of bits specified. | 11 >> 1 gives 5
10 | & (bit-wise AND) | Bit-wise AND of the numbers | 5 & 3 gives 1.
11 | ( | bit-wise OR) | Bitwise OR of the numbers | 5 | 3 gives 7
12 | ^ (bit-wise XOR) | Bitwise XOR of the numbers | 5 ^ 3 gives 6
13 | ~ (bit-wise invert) | The bit-wise inversion of x is -(x+1) | ~5 gives -6
14 | < (less than) | Returns whether x is less than y. | 5 < 3 gives False
15 | > (greater than) | Returns whether x is greater than y | 5 > 3 returns True
16 | <= (less than or equal to) | Returns whether x is less than or equal to y | x = 3; y = 6; x <= y returns True
17 | >= (greater than or equal to) | Returns whether x is greater than or equal to y | x = 4; y = 3; x >= 3 returns True
18 | == (equal to) | Compares if the objects are equal | x = 2; y = 2; x == y returns True
19 | != (not equal to) | Compares if the objects are not equal | x = 2; y = 3; x != y returns True
20 | not (boolean NOT) | If x is True, it returns False. If x is False, it returns True. | x = True; not x returns False.
21 | and (boolean AND) | x and y returns False if x is False, else it returns evaluation of y | x = False; y = True; x and y returns False since x is False.
22 | or (boolean OR) | If x is True, it returns True, else it returns evaluation of y | x = True; y = False; x or y returns True
