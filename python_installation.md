## Installation on Linux

Linux comes with Python installed so no need to install python. Check the python version by below command:

$ python --version
Python 2.7.6
```

## Installation on OS X

## Installation on Windows

Visit (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python 2.7.xx(At the time of writing this tutorial, it is Python 2.7.12). The installation is just like any other windows installer. It is important to remember the path (the directory) where you installed Python. It will be needed later!

One thing to watch out for: on the second screen of the installation wizard, marked "Customize", make sure you scroll down to the "Add python.exe to the Path" option and select "Will be installed on local hard drive", as shown here:
